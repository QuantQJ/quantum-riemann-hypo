# Deployment and Sharing Options

## Current Status
Your Quantum Riemann Research application is built and ready to share! Here are several options for making it accessible to others:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended for Academic Sharing)
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" → main/master
4. Your app will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## Option 2: Netlify (Easy Deployment)
1. Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `dist` folder after building
3. Get instant URL like: `https://random-name.netlify.app`
4. Optional: Connect to GitHub for automatic updates

## Option 3: Vercel (Professional Hosting)
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)  
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Automatic builds and deployments
4. Get URL like: `https://project-name.vercel.app`

## Option 4: Local Development Server
For immediate sharing with colleagues:
1. Run `npm run dev` in your project directory
2. Share the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
3. Note: Only works when your computer is running the server

## Build for Production
To create deployable files:
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist` folder with all files needed for deployment.
