# Planning Guide

A comprehensive scientific documentation platform for organizing and presenting research on quantum simulation of Riemann Zeta zeros via feedback Hamiltonian control and SUSY QM.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Precise** - Mathematical formulations and scientific data must be presented with absolute accuracy and clarity
2. **Professional** - Interface should reflect the serious academic nature of quantum physics research
3. **Accessible** - Complex mathematical concepts made navigable for both experts and students

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
This application needs to organize substantial scientific content across multiple sections with interactive features like parameter exploration and result visualization, but doesn't require user accounts or complex data processing.

## Essential Features

### Paper Structure Navigator
- **Functionality**: Hierarchical navigation through research paper sections with mathematical content rendering
- **Purpose**: Provides organized access to the complete theoretical framework and methodology
- **Trigger**: User clicks on navigation items or uses table of contents
- **Progression**: Landing page → Section selection → Mathematical content display → Cross-references
- **Success criteria**: All mathematical formulas render correctly, smooth navigation between sections

### Parameter Analysis Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Interactive display of parameter sweep results with charts and optimal ranges
- **Purpose**: Allows researchers to explore the relationship between simulation parameters and results
- **Trigger**: User navigates to parameter analysis section
- **Progression**: Dashboard load → Parameter selection → Results visualization → Comparison tools
- **Success criteria**: Charts display correctly, parameter ranges are clearly indicated

### SUSY Analysis Viewer
- **Functionality**: Visualization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics integration results
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the connection between SUSY properties and Riemann zeros
- **Trigger**: User accesses SUSY section from main navigation
- **Progression**: Section entry → Property display → Spectral analysis → Verification metrics
- **Success criteria**: All SUSY calculations and visualizations are properly presented

### Results Verification Center
- **Functionality**: Comprehensive display of all verification metrics and statistical validation
- **Purpose**: Provides authoritative summary of research findings and their significance
- **Trigger**: User wants to review overall research conclusions
- **Progression**: Access verification → Metric display → Statistical analysis → Research conclusions
- **Success criteria**: All metrics display with proper formatting and statistical significance

## Edge Case Handling

- **Large Mathematical Expressions**: Use scrollable containers and responsive text sizing to handle complex formulas
- **Mobile Viewing**: Implement collapsible sections and horizontal scrolling for mathematical content
- **Missing Data**: Display placeholder content with clear indicators when research sections are incomplete
- **Slow Loading**: Progressive loading with skeleton screens for content-heavy sections

## Design Direction

The interface should evoke precision, authority, and intellectual rigor - similar to academic journals and research publications. Clean typography with generous whitespace creates focus on complex mathematical content, while subtle visual hierarchy guides users through intricate theoretical frameworks.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Deep academic blue paired with warm accent colors to create professional contrast while maintaining readability for extensive mathematical content.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Academic Blue (oklch(0.25 0.1 240)) - Communicates scientific authority and precision
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (oklch(0.95 0 0) to oklch(0.3 0 0)) for backgrounds and supporting text
- **Accent Color**: Warm Gold (oklch(0.7 0.15 60)) - Highlights important results and key findings
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.05 240)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.25 0.1 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Gold oklch(0.7 0.15 60)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.05 240)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 15.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey mathematical precision and academic credibility, using fonts optimized for both text readability and mathematical notation display.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Mathematical Content: JetBrains Mono/14px/monospace for code blocks
  - Captions: Inter Regular/14px/muted color

## Animations

Subtle, purpose-driven animations that enhance navigation without distracting from complex scientific content - smooth transitions between sections and gentle hover effects on interactive elements.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth page transitions reinforce the logical flow of scientific reasoning
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Navigation elements receive gentle hover animations, while content sections use fade transitions to maintain focus on mathematical content

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for section organization, Tabs for parameter analysis, Badge for metrics, Table for results data, Separator for content division
- **Customizations**: Custom mathematical formula containers with proper spacing and alignment
- **States**: Hover effects on navigation items, active states for current sections, focus states for accessibility
- **Icon Selection**: ChevronRight for navigation, BarChart for analysis, Calculator for mathematical content, CheckCircle for verified results
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base unit with 24px for section spacing and 8px for tight groupings
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with collapsible navigation, horizontal scroll for wide mathematical expressions, touch-friendly button sizing at 44px minimum
